### Some functions of Molecule class
- Reading and molecular geometry from file
- Translation of molecule (Rotation will be added soon)
- Calculating bond lengths and bond angles (Torsional angles and out-of-plane angles will be added soon)
- Computes the center of mass of the molecule
- Computes moment of inertia tensor of the molecule
